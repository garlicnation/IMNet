{\textcolor{section}{\Section{Introduction}}

\textcolor{subsection}{\subsection{Purpose}}

The purpose of this document is four-fold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Define a full set of requirements for the IM-Net. (These sections correspond to a Software Requirements Document (SRD)).

\item  Define the design for the IM-Net. (These sections correspond to a Software Design Document (SDD)).

\item  Define the Test Plan for the IM-Net. (These sections correspond to a Software Test Plan (STP)).

\item  Define and partially implement feasible modules for the IM-Net.  (These sections correspond to the Software Implementation Document (SID)).
\end{enumerate}

The complete definition of all IM-Net requirements provides the source requirement inputs for the development of the subsequent supporting software subsystems documents.

\textcolor{subsection}{\subsection{Scope}}

The documentation developed as part of this CS437 class, starts from the SRD prepared in CS337 or in previous CS437 classes with a much reduced scope.  The scope of this document includes the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  All functional and non-functional requirements on the IM-Net are captured.  This includes Verification \& Validation (V\&V) requirements, as well as inter-software subsystems requirements.

\item  A complete set of IM-Net Requirements, derived and traceable to the incoming class requirements.  These requirements are organized by key IM-Net functional units shown on the Level 1 DFD given in section 2.0.

\item  A trace matrix, relating all IM-Net functional requirements to functional subunits as expanded in lower level DFDs. Higher level DFDs are provided as part of the design in section 4.0

\item  The functional requirements defined in the IM-Net Requirements section have been expanded to include more specific hardware requirements.
\end{enumerate}

\textcolor{subsubsection}{\subsubsection{Organization}}

The organization of this document provides a natural 'flow' or allocation of requirements to each succeeding section. Details regarding the overall document structure are discussed in sub-section 1.4.

\textcolor{subsubsection}{\subsubsection{Relationship to Other Documents}}

The IM-Net SRD/SDD/STP/SID is a complete self contained document. Some relationships to other documents in the literature are indicated below in sub-section 1.5.

\textcolor{subsection}{\subsection{Project Name Architecture}}
 
\textcolor{subsubsection}{\subsubsection{Detailed Context Diagram (DFD Level 0)}}

The IM-Net architecture is summarized in the Context Diagram (DFD Level 0) given below. A more detailed Functional Description is given in Section 2 of this document.\\

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

The foremost objective of IM-Net is to assist music artists, label and venues in reaching out to their fans through a vibrant, web-based, multimedia interface.

IM-Net is a software application which provides major functions such as the ones listed below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Provides a portal for independent music artists, labels and venues to connect with their fans.

\item  The ability for artists and label to upload and showcase their music to their fans.

\item  Allows music artists, labels and venue to connect to their fans through the messaging interface.
\end{enumerate}

IM-Net is implemented primary using the Django content management system, a web-based framework that closely follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. Data models are framed using Python classes and are stored into a SQL relational database. Views are implemented using Django's Template language, which are used by Django to generate dynamic HTML output. Controllers are Python scripts that describe to the view which particular data will be shown. 

\textcolor{subsection}{\subsection{Documentation Development Process}}

The IM-Net detailed functional description is documented in section 2.0. Basically, Section 2 is a succinct software description document. The overall detailed functional description is based on higher level DFDs (above level 1). All major functional units are described in detail in this part of the document.

Requirements affecting the IM-Net are captured in Section 3.0 of this document.  These requirements are a refinement and completion of requirements first collected as part of a previous Software Engineering project. The document is cited in Section 1.2.2. This section is the one worked in most detail to become a reasonably complete Software Requirements Document (SRD). It includes both functional and non-functional software requirements together with several detailed ``rational'' paragraphs whenever necessary to complete the understanding of each requirement.

Section 4 is the IM-Net detailed Design Description Document (SDD). This part of the document includes all higher level DFDs as described in section 2 plus all interface units. The document is highly technical and it is based on section 2 descriptions. An important component is the addition of a SIS (software interface specification) document in sub-section 4.2.

Section 5 includes elements of a partial implementation of the IM-Net. This section includes the various constraints that effectively limit the implementation as well as the sub-units that will be coded. The implementation goals are defined and the code and pseudo code are included as an attachment to this section.  

Section 6 is the last major section in this document and includes the overall Test Plan (TP) of the IM-Net. The test plan details the various techniques used to test the requirements and it also includes a Validation Matrix where each requirement specified in section 3 is listed with its corresponding validation method. In addition, TP specifies the mandated peer reviews needed to validate the stakeholders part of the requirements.

\textcolor{section}{\Section{Detailed Function Description of IM-Net}}

\textcolor{subsection}{\subsection{Detailed IM-Net Functional Description}}

\textcolor{subsubsection}{\subsubsection{High Level DFDs}}

The IM-Net major functional subunits are shown in the DFD Level 1 depicted below:

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{DFD_level_1.pdf}
\caption{DFD Level 1}
\label{fig:DFD_level_1}
\end{figure}
 
\textcolor{subsubsection}{\subsubsection{Detailed Functional Description of the IM-Net Major Units}}

The description of the function of the IM-Net major functional units shown in Figure \ref{fig:DFD_level_1} follows.

\paragraph{View - Module 2.1}
The View module is responsible for communicating with the user's browser and generating the client-side appearance and functionality of IM-Net. The Web Server Daemon is responsible for routing all HTTP requests and responses to and from the user's browser. The Interpreter function receives all dynamic data from the Controller function in the Content Management module and generates all the dynamic browser content using the predefined Django templates. All template files are static files that are stored locally in the file-system.

\paragraph{Content Management - Module 2.2}
The Content Management module is the interface hub between all other IM-Net modules and the database. All IM-Net data are framed within the Content Management module using the pre-defined Python classes, then stored in the database. The Controller function receives all requests from the View module, gets the appropriate data from the database and other modules, and send the response back to the View module. The Registration function handles all registration requests by creating new user information and permissions in the database, then e-mails the new user their login information. The User-Authentication function handles login requests, querying the database for the proper credentials, and if successful, returns the user's proper permissions. The Messaging function handles all IM-Net internal messaging , i.e., tracking intercommunication in between all IM-Nets users through message threads.

\paragraph{Music-Entity - Module 2.3}
The Music-Entity module provides the Music-Entity abstract superclass that all artists, labels and venues classes are framed upon. The Music-Entity superclass stores a name, unique short-name, description and other metadata common to all Music-Entities. The Artist subclass stores musical genres and a collaborating artists relationship for all music tracks and albums. The Label subclass stores each Artist/Label relationship. The Venue subclass stores physical location information and data-specific events.

\paragraph{Administration - Module 2.4}
The Administration module provides the super-user interface for all IM-Net administrators. The Administration Controller function is responsible for securely editing and deleting any IM-Net Music-Entity data. The Administration Interface is the main interface for IM-Net administrators to perform routine administration tasks such as editing or deleting any of the Music-Entity Artist, Venue or Label data. The Shell Interface is the back-end interface for IM-Net administrators to perform more in-depth maintenance tasks such as creating additional administrator accounts and account password changes. 

\paragraph{Media - Module 2.5}
The Media module handles the safe and secure storage of all IM-Net media files in the IM-Net Media Store. The Media Store function stores and manages all auditory media files that are uploaded by IM-Net Artists, Labels or Venues. The Security function ensures that no malicious code is uploaded to IM-Net by interfacing with commercial anti-virus to scan each individual file that is uploaded by IM-Net users.

\textcolor{section}{\Section{The IM-Net Requirements}}
 
\textcolor{subsection}{\subsection{IM-Net Functional Requirements}}

This Section collects all the IM-Net Functional Requirements. This section includes the complete set of functional requirements with explanation and rational where the statement of the requirement was deemed insufficient or needing additional background/justification. All requirements relate to the design modules described in Section 2. An effort has been made to standardize the correlation between the design modules and the requirements to make their access and organization more consistent. For example, requirement number ``n'' affecting module 2.1 will be labeled 3.1-n.

\textcolor{section}{\Section{IM-Net Test Plan}}

\textcolor{subsection}{\subsection{Introduction}}

In this section the testing methodology to be used to Verify and Validate each of the requirements listed in section 3.0 has been identified. At points some additional testing may be required and they shall be documented as an attachment to this document. 

The methodologies and testing strategies identified at this point include three major approaches with various variations to adapt to the IM-Net project:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Testing using addition ad-hoc crated software including a correlation testing unit.

\item  Demonstration of the specified capability

\item  Inspection of the software code possibly using addition inspection techniques
\end{enumerate}
